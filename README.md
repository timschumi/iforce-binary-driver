# logitech-wmff-driver
An updated Immersion-based driver from Saitek for Win7+ x64

## Supported devices
* Logitech WingMan Formula Force
* AVB Force Feedback Racing Wheel

## Installation

**Warning:** This driver is not digitally signed. For Windows versions which have "driver
signature enforcement" enabled (definitely Windows 10, maybe even Windows 8), you have to
disable that before installing the driver.
**Warning:** Please note that antivirus software may interfere to prevent the installation of unsigned drivers.

For installation, you just have to download a [current repository archive](https://github.com/timschumi/logitech-wmff-driver/archive/master.zip) and
extract it somewhere. Then, go into the device manager, right-click on your device, press
"Update driver", "Search for drivers on my computer" and select the folder you previously
extracted.
